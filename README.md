# calendar
Using the raw javascript to write a calendar plugin.

The plugin contains js/calendar.js and css/calendarCSS.css.

Next,I will explain my idea how I wrote the calendar plugin.

There are 4 main steps to  complete the calendar.

    1、Using the html to sketch out a general calendar skeleton without days,then append to the element you wanted;

    2、According to the current time,dynamic assignment to the calendar:the current year and month;

    3、Then,according to the year and month,draw the days of current month;

    4、last writing a 'improveCalendar' funciton ,if the year select and month select changed,they will trigger the function,thus,the           days will change to the exact date

    For details,please enjoy the demo
